---+ FamilyTree

FamilyTree is a simple web application using JavaServerFaces, Java EE, and a SQL database to load, display, edit, and examine a family tree. It was initially created as a project for CS7700 Advanced Database Systems at Wright State, and is currently being used for CS7720 Data Mining at the same school.

---++ Contents of Repository

---+++ Configuration files

---++++ NetBeans Configuration Files

This repository contains two NetBeans configuration files, namely [[https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/FamilyTree/blob/master/nb-configuration.xml][=nb-configuration.xml=]] and [[https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/FamilyTree/blob/master/nbactions.xml][=nbactions.xml=]]. 

---++++ IntelliJ Configuration Files

In addition to NetBeans configuration, it contains an IntelliJ configuration file [[https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/FamilyTree/blob/master/familyTree.iml][=familyTree.iml=]] and configuration directory [[https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/FamilyTree/blob/master/.idea/][=.idea/=]].

---++++ Maven Configuration Files

Also, it contains the standard Maven [[pom.xml][=pom.xml=]] and an extra [[https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/FamilyTree/blob/master/ojdbc7.pom][=ojdbc7.pom=]] to install Oracle's JDBC driver into the local repository.

---++++ Git Configuration File

Finally, it contains [[https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/FamilyTree/blob/master/.gitignore][=.gitignore=]] so I don't accidently commit and push things I don't want onto GitHub.

---+++ Source code

The following types of files can be found in this project:

* =*.java=
* =*.xhtml=
* =*.sql=

The following types of files are not currently found in this project, but some may be added in the future:

* =*.css=
* =*.js=

---+++ SQL

All the necessary SQL statements to create the database (should be) is in [[https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/FamilyTree/blob/master/sql/master.sql][sql/master.sql]]. All the subdirectories in [[https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/FamilyTree/blob/master/sql/][sql/]] contain pretty much the same material as master.sql, they are only in different directories for easier human viewing.

---+++ Directory structure

If any directory structure of this project does not match the standard Maven configuration, the aim is to eventually change this project to match a standard Maven project.

---++ Setup

Once this project is downloaded, there is one step required before it can be built by Maven.

1. Download and install =ojdbc7.jar=

   This can be found at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/jdbc-drivers-12c-download-1958347.html. If that's a dead link, try [[https://www.google.com/search?q=ojdbc7.jar][Googling =ojdbc7.jar=]].

   Install the jar file with one of the following ways:

   a. =mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.oracle -DartifactId=ojdbc7 -Dversion=12.1.0.1 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=ojdbc7.jar -DgeneratePom=true=<br />
   b. =mvn install:install-file -Dfile=ojdbc7.jar -DpomFile=ojdbc7.pom=<br />
   c. I've included the equivalent of option b as a Maven action in NetBeans. In NetBeans, under the Projects view, right-click your project, go to "Custom", and select "install ojdbc7".
   
In order to run this project, a Java EE server and a SQL database need to be installed beforehand. I use [[https://glassfish.java.net/][GlassFish 4.1]] and [[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/overview/index.html][Oracle Database 11g Express Edition]]. You will also need to setup a JDBC connection pool in your Java EE server. [[https://computingat40s.wordpress.com/how-to-setup-a-jdbc-connection-in-glassfish/][I found this website helpful for setting it up in GlassFish.]] The settings I used (other than username and password) are:

| Pool name:  | FamilyTreePool |
| Resource type: | java.sql.Driver |
| Database Driver Vendor:  | Oracle |
| Initial and Minimum Pool Size: | Zero |
| URL: | jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE |
