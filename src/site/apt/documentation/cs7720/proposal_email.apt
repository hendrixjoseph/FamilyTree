  All,
  For those individuals that have not been approved yet, please send me your Data Mining proposals ASAP.  I would like to have them in my Inbox by Saturday.  For those proposals that are sent and received after 12:00 p.m. on Friday, I will review Sunday evening. Thank you for your support!
  Thanks,Eric
